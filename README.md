***A New Chapter Begins: Unfolding the Student Induction Program 2025 at GNDEC Ludhiana***

"Education is the passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to those who prepare for it today." – Malcolm X

On the serene morning of 31st July, 2025, the campus of Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College, Ludhiana, brimmed with anticipation and youthful exuberance as it welcomed the newest members of its academic family — the freshers of Computer Science and Information Technology. The day marked the commencement of the Student Induction Program 2025, an event meticulously curated to ignite passion, foster belonging, and instill in every newcomer a sense of purpose.

The proceedings began at 8:30 AM in the sanctified presence of the Gurdwara Sahib, where students gathered in reverence and reflection. The spiritual start infused the day with a profound sense of calm and clarity, setting the tone for the journey ahead.Students were encouraged to observe the unique structure of the Gurdwara Sahib, which resembles a ship (jahaz)—symbolic of the spiritual journey it offers. Inside, the Kirtani Jatha recited soothing shabads, with the profound message “ਵਾਹਿਗੁਰੂ ਨਾਮ ਜਹਾਜ਼ ਹੈ ਚੜੇ ਸੋ ਉਤਰੇ ਪਾਰ”, reminding everyone that the divine name of Waheguru is the vessel that carries souls safely across life’s ocean. A touching moment during the Gurdwara Sahib session was when a young girl soulfully recited prayers and kirtan, while a little boy played the nagada with quiet devotion. 

![E62509EC-C784-495A-ADEC-A0A6A9286963](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/19d85521-d78a-4a66-87ec-e820d38060fe)

The college had the immense honor of hosting two distinguished Guests of Honour:

Shri Ravindra Garg, Chief Engineer, Municipal Corporation, Ludhiana, addressed the students with a heartfelt and impactful message. He encouraged them to enjoy their college life but reminded them to do so within limits and with responsibility. Emphasizing the sacrifices and investments made by their parents, he urged students not to take this phase of life lightly.

![A2FE25BE-C8C3-4081-98C2-32D58CE59559](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3a9d726c-abad-49d4-9853-f4f81fb39a79)


He left them with a powerful thought: “If you choose to enjoy now without discipline, you may suffer later; but if you stay focused now, you will enjoy the fruits of your efforts in the future.” His words served as a timely reminder of the importance of balance, gratitude, and long-term vision in a student’s life.

![63612873-8257-4170-8288-F748399EE42C](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32570a51-4e3c-4af5-a1cf-c11904141fb1)


Engineer Rakesh Kumar, a distinguished alumnus from the 1991 batch and currently serving as ADC, Ludhiana, delivered an inspiring address that beautifully bridged the past and present.

Reflecting on his own journey from the classrooms of GNDEC to a position of administrative leadership, he credited the college for laying the strong foundation of his career. With deep emotion, he shared the poetic line:

“ਕਲੇਜੇ ਤੀਰ ਦੇਖਣ ਨੂੰ, ਤੇ ਸਿਰ ਤੇ ਤਾਜ ਦੇਖਣ ਨੂੰ,

ਬੜੀ ਬੇਤਾਬ ਹੈ ਦੁਨੀਆ, ਤੇਰੀ ਪਰਵਾਜ਼ ਦੇਖਣ ਨੂੰ”

—reminding students that the world eagerly watches their rise, their struggles, and their triumphs. His words resonated deeply, encouraging students to aim high and honor the legacy of the institution through their actions and achievements.

"Success is not the key to happiness. Happiness is the key to success. If you love what you are doing, you will be successful." – Albert Schweitzer

The event concluded on a high note with a captivating interaction with Shri Ashok Singla, Financial Advisor, whose experiential wisdom and encouraging words provided the students with valuable direction. His pragmatic approach to career, finance, and life planning left a lasting impression on the audience.He addressed a crucial aspect of every student’s academic journey—financial planning.

![EF47B226-CDD5-45E7-A2F5-15EF1DF549F7](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e1a64516-80f2-421d-8e93-19591d2f86ff)


He introduced the students to the Vidya Lakshmi Education Loan Scheme, a government-backed portal that acts as a single-window platform for students seeking education loans. Shri Singla explained how the portal connects students with multiple banks and allows them to apply for loans, track applications, and receive guidance through a streamlined and transparent process. His session was especially beneficial for students who may require financial assistance to pursue their academic goals. By highlighting this resource, he encouraged students not to let financial constraints hinder their aspirations and assured them that support is available through proper channels when approached with the right intent and planning.



The first day of the induction program was much more than a ceremonial welcome — it was a celebration of potential, a convergence of experiences, and a beacon of inspiration for the Class of 2025. The seamless blend of motivation, mentorship, and meaningful dialogue created an atmosphere charged with enthusiasm and institutional pride.

With this, the corridors of GNDEC echo not only with knowledge but with stories waiting to unfold.

I extend my heartfelt gratitude to the management, faculty, organizing team,all the dignitaries, speakers, and participants for making the opening of the Student Induction Program 2025 a truly memorable and impactful event.

A significant highlight of Day 2 was the expert lecture delivered by Dr. Arshdeep Singh, a seasoned professional in Food Technology at Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), Ludhiana. His session, titled “Food: A Pivotal Role in Student’s Overall Wellness,” offered the students valuable insights into the critical link between nutrition, lifestyle, and academic performance.

He began by emphasizing the importance of incorporating nutritionally rich and traditional foods such as millets and ghee into one’s daily diet. He explained that while our ancestors consumed large quantities of such foods due to their physically intensive lifestyles, today’s generation must consume them mindfully in line with modern activity levels. He introduced the concept of nutraceuticals—foods that provide medicinal or health benefits—including dark chocolate, advising students to choose such healthier alternatives for sustained growth and wellness.

He cautioned against the excessive consumption of refined sugars and carbonated beverages, pointing out that popular soft drinks like cola contain phosphoric acid and chemical sugars that can be harmful, while other sugary drinks often contain sucrose, offering little to no nutritional value. He highlighted that many so-called fruit drinks are merely flavored sugar beverages and not real fruit-based products.

Furthermore, he addressed popular fitness misconceptions, clarifying doubts related to the use of protein supplements among gym-going students. He explained the science behind macronutrients and stressed the importance of sourcing proteins and nutrients from natural, balanced diets over commercial products whenever possible.

One particularly impactful moment came when he addressed a common myth surrounding vitiligo, clarifying that it is a hereditary condition, not one caused by any particular food combination. His empathetic approach helped dispel fears and remove stigma related to the condition.


![84A107F2-818B-4036-8712-3E6C7603F6F8](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e4a1ac71-cdd7-4a15-a28a-8be230ef4799)

He concluded the session by encouraging students to make informed dietary choices, manage their stress levels to avoid emotional overeating, and approach wellness with a balanced and educated mindset. His talk was not only informative but also highly engaging, leaving students with a deeper appreciation of how food choices directly impact their academic success, physical health, and emotional well-being.

Following the insightful session on nutrition and wellness by Dr. Arshdeep Singh, the focus shifted to technical skill-building, essential for students in the fields of Computer Science and Information Technology. College faculty and technical professionals conducted a practical tutorial on GitHub, one of the most widely used platforms for version control and collaborative software development. Students were guided through the account creation process, introduced to key features of the platform, and shown how to begin building a professional coding portfolio.

**Closing Note – Day 2**

Day 2 concluded with a well-rounded experience that combined academic assessment, health awareness, and technical learning. The sessions equipped students with essential insights and skills, laying a solid foundation for their journey at GNDEC.

***Rooted in Values, Rising with Vision – Day 3 of the Student Induction Program 2025 at GNDEC Ludhiana***

The third day of the Student Induction Program 2025 at Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College, Ludhiana, continued to inspire and inform the newly admitted students of the Computer Science and Engineering and Information Technology branches. Held in the college auditorium, the day's agenda focused on cultivating intellectual curiosity, ethical grounding, and personal growth.

The program opened with an engaging and thought-provoking session by Dr. Jaswinder Singh, recipient of the Siksharatan Award, who brought science to life through interactive demonstrations and live experiments. His unique teaching style sparked curiosity and transformed traditional learning into a memorable experience for the students.

**Dr. Jaswinder Singh’s** session was not only educational but deeply **philosophical and inspiring**. He began by engaging students with the profound meaning behind the greeting *"Sat Sri Akal"*, encouraging them to reflect on its spiritual depth. With a powerful message of **"doing less, but doing it with efficiency and focus,"** he motivated students to value clarity and depth in learning over mere quantity. Highlighting the **role of teachers as guides and well-wishers**, he reminded students that while everything may feel new, the faculty's mission is to **support, uplift, and help them rise**.


![873E071B-954E-4A17-8541-D16839FB2E14](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff1e62dd-781b-4a55-915e-b8342c801de7)

He emphasized the importance of building a **strong foundation**, noting that while the structure may be ready, the **base often remains fragile**—and this is where students must begin. Expressing gratitude for his journey, he humbly acknowledged, *“What I am today is because of ੴ.”*

Dr. Singh beautifully connected **science, spirituality, and education**, explaining that **Gurbani is like a seed of success**—which grows into branches, flowers, and fruits, each carrying the potential to plant new beginnings. He spoke of **mathematics as the universal foundation**, the root of time, science, and understanding itself, yet a subject feared by many. Urging students to **face challenges without fear**, he encouraged them to **seek help, stay curious, and trust the learning process**.

Quoting poet **Surjit Patar**, he left a lasting impact with the words:

*"ਮੈਂ ਰਾਹਾਂ ਤੇ ਨਹੀਂ ਤੁਰਦਾ,
ਮੈਂ ਤੁਰਦਾ ਹਾਂ ਤਾਂ ਰਾਹ ਬਣਦੇ ਨੇ"* –

*“I don’t walk on paths, I walk and paths are created.”*

This line became a powerful reminder for students to **lead with courage, create their own journey, and redefine success on their own terms.**

Further enriching his session, Dr. Jaswinder Singh urged the students to realign their focus with purpose and intention. He emphasized that while Gurbani serves as a guiding light, helping one channelize energy and thoughts, the real challenge lies within the students themselves. He poignantly pointed out a fundamental flaw in the current learning culture: “Children sit in classrooms without knowing how to truly be present, without understanding their purpose, or how to manage time—they are living without direction.” Reframing the idea of education, he stated that “classrooms are not just rooms for teaching; they are training grounds for life.”

He encouraged the students to begin their transformation with self-reflection—to look into the mirror, face themselves with honesty, and have a conversation with their own soul. Drawing inspiration from the legendary Punjabi poet Bhai Veer Singh Ji, he narrated a moving poetic moment where the poet, in deep contemplation, conversed with a rose on a calm morning—and the flower, as if awakened by emotion, seemed to respond. He recited the lines:

"ਡਾਲੀ ਨਾਲੋਂ ਤੋੜ ਨ ਸਾਨੂੰ, ਅਸਾਂ ਹੱਟ 'ਮਹਿਕ' ਦੀ ਲਾਈ!

ਲੱਖ ਗਾਹਕ ਜੇ ਸੁੰਘੇ ਆਕੇ, ਖਾਲੀ ਇਕ ਨ ਜਾਈ,

ਤੂੰ ਜੇ ਇਕ ਤੋੜ ਕੇ ਲੈ ਗਿਓ, ਇਕ ਜੋਗਾ ਰਹਿ ਜਾਸਾਂ,—

ਉਹ ਭੀ ਪਲਕ ਝਲਕ ਦਾ ਮੇਲਾ– ਰੂਪ ਮਹਿਕ ਨਸ ਜਾਈ।੧੩"

![8AF5F432-D799-4731-B237-B0E202174DDE_4_5005_c](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/38855700-f20d-4bd5-b2c9-694bfaddd306)


Through this sir beautifully conveyed that true essence cannot be plucked, possessed, or rushed—it must be experienced, respected, and allowed to blossom naturally. The poetry was not just a literary reference but a gentle call to the students to live mindfully, seek depth, and honour their own uniqueness, just as a flower spreads fragrance without losing its identity.

Continuing his deeply philosophical address, Dr. Jaswinder Singh drew a powerful metaphor from nature—the flow of water. He asked a simple yet profound question: “Does water ever stop?” The answer, echoing in silence, became the basis of his reflection on movement, persistence, and purpose. Just like water, he said, a seeker, a learner, a dreamer must keep flowing—uninterrupted and unafraid.

To encapsulate this thought, he recited a stirring verse by Bhai Veer Singh Ji:

"ਸੀਨੇ ਖਿੱਚ ਜਿਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਨੇ ਖਾਧੀ,

ਓਹ ਕਰ ਅਰਾਮ ਨਹੀਂ ਬਹਿੰਦੇ ।

ਨਿਹੁੰ ਵਾਲੇ ਨੈਣਾਂ ਕੀ ਨੀਂਦਰ,

ਓਹ ਦਿਨੇ ਰਾਤ ਪਏ ਵਹਿੰਦੇ ।"

These lines painted the image of restless yearning—those who have once tasted the pull of deep longing, of true love, of purpose, cannot rest. Their minds and souls, like ever-flowing streams, continue to move—seeking, thinking, questioning. Dr. Singh beautifully tied this to the essence of science itself, saying, “Science begins with wonder—with the desire to know.” In that moment, learning became more than curriculum—it became a journey of the spirit.


Dr. Jaswinder Singh continued to inspire with the message that life is a once-in-a-lifetime gift—and must be lived with purpose and learning at its core. Emphasizing that true success lies in learning, not just studying, he encouraged students to pursue knowledge with sincerity and curiosity.

![F673A710-22A5-40B6-9F00-6CDF4A4AD251](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ed683c6-52ec-4702-a267-4a350f199069)


To illustrate this, he shared a profound anecdote from the childhood of Guru Nanak Dev Ji, where the young Nanak humbly questioned his teacher, Gopal Pandha Ji: "I have written 'One'—but why should I proceed to write 'Two' when I have not yet understood 'One'?" This deep humility and thirst for understanding, he said, is what modern students must rediscover.

Drawing a timeless comparison, Dr. Singh urged students to become seekers like Guru Nanak Dev Ji, who spent his entire life in pursuit of the truth and ultimately arrived at the essence of the divine—ੴ (Ik Onkar). He beautifully explained Guru Nanak Dev Ji’s interpretation:

"ਇਕੁ ਸੰਸਾਰੀ, ਇਕੁ ਭੰਡਾਰੀ, ਇਕੁ ਲਾਏ ਦੀਬਾਣੁ ॥"

" ਜਿਵ ਤਿਸੁ ਭਾਵੈ, ਤਿਵੈ ਚਲਾਵੈ, ਜਿਵ ਹੋਵੈ ਫੁਰਮਾਣੁ ॥"

Meaning that the One is the Creator, Sustainer, and Destroyer—the ultimate power that governs the universe. This story served not just as a spiritual lesson, but also as a reminder to students to ask questions, seek understanding, and learn with depth and reverence.


 He  introduced the students to the concept of ਅਧਿਆਤਮ (spirituality)—the journey inward. He urged everyone to practice introspection, to “see with closed eyes and listen without ears,” reminding us that the answers we seek are not scattered across the world, but reside within us. “We keep searching outside,” he said, “but what is truly lost lies within.”

He recited the shabad:

"ਕੀਤਾ ਪਸਾਉ ਏਕੋ ਕਵਾਉ, ਤਿਸ ਤੇ ਹੋਏ ਲਖ ਦਰੀਆਉ ॥"

(You created the vast expanse of the Universe with One Word. Hundreds of thousands of rivers began to flow.)

 It reflects the infinite power of the Divine, whose presence surrounds us at every moment—we only need to change the way we perceive. His message was clear: God exists. Truth exists. But we must learn to seek it with the right vision—the vision of inner awareness.

**Science of Self and Surroundings: A Session on Physics and Introspection**

Further enriching the day, Dr. Jaswinder Singh conducted an engaging, interactive session that seamlessly blended physics with personal insight. To demonstrate the power of self-awareness and natural laws, he led the students through a simple yet thought-provoking activity—he asked them to stand against a wall and attempt to lift one leg. As neither the students nor he himself could maintain balance, he emphasized the underlying message: we are under our own command, and it is essential to understand the science within us.


![BC29131E-C003-466A-8919-EF265570A28D](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a7d840e8-528b-42d4-85bf-56162a0d7c79)

He reminded students that physics is the study of nature and natural phenomena, and that the principles of balance and vibration are not only external but internal as well. To illustrate this, he encouraged students to clap and observe how the air molecules vibrated, humorously adding that even bacteria dispersed due to the vibrations—only to land somewhere else. Through this, he stressed the importance of remaining in “vibration mode”—alert, responsive, and in motion.

<img width="2543" height="2046" alt="1A4166CA-B275-4B37-81E1-8804959B72A8_1_201_a (1)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c363718-bab9-458b-aae2-36c7c6a7194b" />


He then demonstrated a wave transmission activity using a string of straws taped together. 


<img width="4032" height="3024" alt="66604F2A-AC2A-4158-B0DB-4CE89F289915 (1)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cbd4ede6-8359-4ca8-80b5-e6eaebd45860" />


When a disturbance was introduced at one end, energy propagated across all the straws—faster when held tightly, and slower when loose. This served as a metaphor: progress and momentum in life are directly linked to our activeness and consistency.

![EDA1077C-5706-4B79-B405-B6AD1CD372FA](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/656763b0-bc35-4b30-bca0-f81f2f042660)



Building on the demonstration, he introduced the fundamental concepts of transverse and longitudinal waves, explaining that both types of waves exist not only in the universe but within ourselves. He spoke about the eyes as optical instruments, explaining how light enables vision—tying basic physics principles to everyday experiences.

In his thought-provoking narrative, he referenced renowned scientists such as Isaac Newton and his discovery of VIBGYOR, and Galileo Galilei, who, despite being misunderstood in his time, is now revered for his contributions. Through these examples, he conveyed that true knowledge often begins with observation and courage to question the norm.  

In a deeply symbolic demonstration, he introduced the students to the singing bowl—a traditional instrument known for producing meditative sound frequencies. Initially, he struck the bowl to produce two distinct sounds—one harmonious and pleasant, the other discordant and unsettling. This contrast illustrated how not all noise is music, and not all speech is understanding.

He then began to gently rotate the mallet around the rim of the bowl, gradually creating a resonant, calming tone that enveloped the room. The sustained vibration that emerged was soothing and beautiful, in stark contrast to the earlier jarring sounds.

Through this, he conveyed a powerful metaphor: just as the bowl produces its most harmonious sound when approached with patience and the right technique, students too must learn to truly "listen" to their teachers. He likened the teacher’s role to the guiding hand that carefully draws out a student’s potential—transforming dissonance into resonance. When students attune themselves to learning with focus and respect, the outcome can be as profound and beautiful as the music of the singing bowl.

He further shared the inspiring story of Carl Friedrich Gauss, who, as a young boy, amazed his teacher by quickly calculating the sum of numbers from 1 to 100. While others added numbers sequentially, Gauss cleverly paired them—1 and 100, 2 and 99, and so on—recognizing a pattern and arriving at the answer using a simple formula. Dr. Singh used this to emphasize the power of observation, pattern recognition, and thinking beyond conventional methods.

Throughout the session, students were not only introduced to the wonders of physics but were encouraged to connect scientific thought with self-reflection, purpose, and clarity—an experience that made learning deeply personal, practical, and inspiring.

In one of the most thought-provoking moments of the session, Sir recited the powerful couplet by Allama Iqbal:

"ख़ुदी को कर बुलंद इतना कि हर तक़दीर से पहले,

ख़ुदा बंदे से ख़ुद पूछे, बता तेरी रज़ा क्या है।"

—emphasizing the importance of self-realization and spiritual elevation in shaping one’s destiny.

He then engaged the students in a practical learning activity, asking them about the number of bones in the human body. While many correctly answered "206", none could confidently identify the specific distribution. To make the concept tangible, he invited students on stage to physically count and locate the bones in their own bodies—bridging theoretical knowledge with experiential learning.

Expanding the discourse into the realm of faith and service, he touched upon the Khalsa Panth, highlighting the role of prayer as the seed of action, which then blossoms into branches, flowers, and fruits—each bearing new seeds. Through this metaphor, he conveyed that consistent spiritual practice cultivates growth, purpose, and impact.

He also spoke passionately about his aspiration to work with humanitarian organizations like the Red Cross and Khalsa Aid, underlining the value of selfless service, empathy, and global citizenship in the life of a student.

To illustrate the power of prayer and unwavering devotion, Sir narrated the story of Dhruva, a young prince. After being denied his father's affection due to palace favoritism, Dhruva turned to his mother, who advised him to seek God's love through prayer. At just five years old, he left for the forest and began intense meditation. Despite challenges like wild animals and severe weather, he remained undeterred. Impressed by his devotion, God appeared before Dhruva, but the young boy sought nothing but divine presence. As a reward, God granted him eternal glory, making him shine forever as the Pole Star—Dhruva Tara, a symbol of steadfastness and spiritual triumph.

At one point during the session, Sir wrote the number 108 on the blackboard—prompting curiosity among the students. While many associated the number with the emergency helpline, he offered a much deeper, symbolic interpretation rooted in spirituality, nature, and balance.

He explained that:

The ‘1’ signifies the presence of One Supreme Power—God.

The ‘0’ stands for the cosmic feminine energy and celestial bodies like the Moon, Earth, and Sun—emphasizing that all creation emerges from the feminine.

The ‘8’ represents materialism, wealth, and worldly pursuits.

Together, 1-0-8 becomes a powerful metaphor for life: a reminder that while divine connection (1) and universal creation (0) are essential, one must learn to navigate and balance material existence (8) without losing spiritual grounding.

Emphasizing the power of consistent devotion, Sir quoted the sacred verse from Sukhmani Sahib Ji — “ਸਿਮਰਉ ਸਿਮਰਿ ਸਿਮਰਿ ਸੁਖ ਪਾਵਉ” — to beautifully underline the importance of repetition in prayer and remembrance of the Divine.

Furthermore, to deepen the students' understanding of numerical significance, Sir explained that the number 9 symbolizes the universe and holds the key to many mathematical mysteries and solutions. To demonstrate this, he invited a student to write any three-digit number with distinct digits on the board. He then asked the student to reverse the digits and subtract the smaller number from the larger one. To everyone’s amazement, the result of the subtraction consistently turned out to be 247. This simple yet powerful exercise left the students in awe of the inherent patterns and symmetry in mathematics, reinforcing the idea that numbers, too, are a reflection of the universe’s divine order.

In a lively demonstration, Sir poured fuel into a bottle, lit it, and the bottle shot into the air. He explained that oxygen is essential for burning, and carbon dioxide is a byproduct. Through this, he illustrated the basic principle of how vehicle engines work.


In a powerful moment, Sir wrote "ਭਗਵਾਨ" on the board and said, “Now you can't say you've never seen God.” He explained that the universe was created with five elements, and even today, science has not discovered a sixth. No one has the power to unite these five elements the way the Creator did.


The event was further elevated by the presence of the Chief Guest, Sardar Gurcharan Singh Grewal, a respected member of the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) and the Nankana Sahib Education Trust. In his address, he emphasized the need to uphold cultural and moral values while pursuing academic success. His words resonated with the students, urging them to remain grounded, disciplined, and focused as they navigate their educational journey.

**Embracing the Essence of Life: A Soulful Session by Priya Darshni Ma’am**

In a deeply reflective and emotionally stirring session, Priya Darshni Ma’am guided students through the often-overlooked corridors of the human heart and mind under the theme of Universal Human Values. Her words resonated like a quiet call to awaken—not just academically, but spiritually and emotionally.

She invited students to pause and truly ask themselves: What is my aim? What is my passion? Am I moving towards it, or away from it? She spoke not just of careers or academics, but of dreams, aspirations, and the silent desires of the soul—the ones we often bury beneath expectations and noise.

Ma’am beautifully unfolded the truth that being independent is not just about standing alone, but about standing true—true to oneself, one’s purpose, and one’s inner calling. In a world obsessed with name, fame, and money, she reminded us that the real treasures of life lie in happiness and prosperity of the heart—not just the wallet.

She posed heartfelt questions that made everyone pause and reflect:
Have the 15 or 18 years we’ve lived so far brought us closer to joy, or further into stress? Are we racing ahead or losing our way? Are we building a future or just surviving the present?

Her message was clear and powerful: Happiness is not a destination but a direction. And prosperity is not just about wealth, but about inner richness, balance, and contentment. But to walk this path, we must first open our eyes, and then our hearts.

She urged the students to evaluate, introspect, and realign—to find not just what they want to become, but who they want to be.

In her words echoed wisdom, and in her presence, a quiet strength that moved many hearts. It was not just a session. It was a mirror held up to our lives.


 She spoke on the indispensable role of ethics and empathy in technical education and professional life. Her session encouraged students to view engineering not only as a career path but also as a means to serve society with responsibility and integrity.

As the day drew to a close, students were left with a renewed understanding that knowledge gains significance when coupled with values. Day 3 successfully reinforced GNDEC’s commitment to shaping not just skilled engineers, but conscientious and value-driven individuals ready to contribute meaningfully to the world.

**Closing Note – Day 3**

Day 3 of the induction program concluded on a thoughtful and transformative note. From deep philosophical insights to hands-on scientific experiments, the sessions inspired students to reflect on their purpose, values, and aspirations. With a blend of spirituality, science, and self-awareness, the day encouraged every student to begin the journey of learning—not just for knowledge, but for life itself.

***INDUCTION PROGRAMME:DAY 4***

**AUGUST 4,2025**

**HIGHLIGHTS**

-Peer to peer learning sesssion

-Expert Lecture by Dr. Priya Darshni Madam on "Universal Human Values" - AUDITORIUM

-Causmic Club

**"Day 4: Mind, Machines & Meaning — A Journey Within and Beyond"**

Following an insightful morning of peer-to-peer learning in C++ and the foundational concepts of electronics and electrical engineering, students gathered in the auditorium for a thought-provoking session by Priya Darshni Ma’am, centered on Universal Human Values.

Ma’am began by bringing our scattered attention to one universal struggle: Distraction. Through her words, she gradually peeled away the layers of noise we live with — social pressure, external validation, and the unrelenting buzz of the outside world — to reveal something often neglected: our inner voice.

She spoke of Natural Acceptance, a state of knowing what is right without external instruction. Much like a car knows its direction when driven with clarity, she explained that we too carry our own answers — we only need to listen. Using the analogy of a circus, she reminded us that while the world may be chaotic, it’s our focus that defines the outcome.

Addressing emotions like anger, she emphasized that they are natural, but our reaction is our responsibility. Self-control, she said, is not suppression but self-understanding. “Labs don’t just exist in classrooms,” she noted, “they exist in life.” And life, with all its unpredictability, is the real test bed.

Delving deeper, she introduced the powerful concept of a loop between imagination and behavior. The roots of our decisions — our desires, thoughts, and expectations — stem from imagination. If these are flawed, the behavior that follows can’t be right either. She explained that we often mistake external guidance (pre-conditioning or sensory attraction) for truth, ignoring the compass of our own Natural Acceptance. Whether it's craving a fast bike because of its looks, or reaching for fast food despite knowing it’s unhealthy — these come from temporary inputs, not from inner clarity.

She challenged us to question:

Are we living in contradiction, or are we guided by what truly feels right?

As she spoke on relationship dependency, she laid bare a difficult truth: when our sense of worth depends on someone else's validation, appreciation, or company, we lose our inner anchor. True peace comes when one is independent — guided not by the shifting winds of others’ opinions, but by ethics and self-awareness.

In a world that confuses wants with needs, she beautifully highlighted that physical facilities are for the body, not the self. The body seeks protection and nurture, but the soul seeks continuity of happiness and understanding. These are not given; they are cultivated.

Her question, “What is life?”, echoed deeply. The answer wasn't given in grand theories, but in a simple reflection —

Life is to understand, to grow, and to live with constant happiness and development.

She urged us to stop measuring ourselves through comparisons, and instead guide ourselves first, with clarity, honesty, and self-respect. Because in truth, as she powerfully reminded us — happiness that is dependent is not happiness at all.

As the day unfolded with deep reflections on human values, the next wave of insight came through Harpreet Ma’am, who seamlessly blended psychology, inner discipline, and the realities of human behavior into a powerful session that left many of us reflecting silently.

She began with a strong analogy — the force water pump — to demonstrate that just as we apply force to extract water from the depths of the earth, we need to apply an inner force of discipline to draw out the best within ourselves. Just as water doesn't rise without pressure, transformation doesn’t happen without effort.

"To be a good human being," she said, "you need to apply that inner force every single day."

Harpreet Ma’am emphasized that our mind is the fastest entity in the universe — faster than sound, faster than light — and if left unchecked, it can spiral out of control. But if mastered, it becomes the most powerful tool one can possess.
She likened this to a remote control, which must lie in our hands, not in the hands of distractions, anger, or comparison.

She reminded us that life is a loop — we are not trapped in it, but we often create our own loops of behavior, emotion, and overthinking. The only way to break these loops is by facing ourselves honestly. Stay honest with yourself, she said, because the moment you lie to yourself, your direction is lost.

Harpreet Ma’am also deeply acknowledged Priya Darshni Ma’am’s selfless contribution, highlighting how someone with a PhD in Electronics, capable of earning accolades and riches, chose to give direction to society without asking for a single rupee. A true example of intention over transaction, purpose over position.

She then guided us toward understanding engineering not just as a subject, but as a mindset.

“Problem-solving in engineering begins when you learn to counsel yourself.”
“No problem is above you. Nothing in life is greater than your will to overcome.”

She spoke of the human condition — how man is a social animal, and how solitude isn’t weakness, but comparison is poison. We compare too often, she said, and that comparison slowly chips away at our self-worth.

Harpreet Ma’am also delved into the emotional spectrum of life — dukh and sukh, sorrow and joy — and reminded us that these are constants. What defines our journey is how we navigate them, whether we let pain control us or we learn from it.

“Life is a lesson — not always easy, not always fair — but always rich with meaning. You are not just moving from birth to death, you are shaping your destination along the way.”

She concluded with a truth many of us needed to hear — that anger, often born from thoughts, is more damaging to us than anyone else.

“Soch ke gussa aunda hai, par sab ton vadda nuksaan apna hi hunda hai.”

Your willingness to learn, your intention, and your inner voice must become your guiding light. And when that happens, you will no longer be waiting for life to give you meaning —
you will become the meaning yourself.

The day also marked the official launch of the Causmic Club, where the executive members were introduced with great excitement and promise for student-led initiatives ahead.

This was followed by an insightful session by Ayush Sir, who guided students on how to choose the perfect laptop—breaking down specifications, needs, and budgets in a simple, practical manner.


**Closing Note – Day 4**

Day 4 concluded on a thoughtful and inspiring note. From technical learning and self-reflection to meaningful discussions on ethics, purpose, and personal growth — the day offered a perfect blend of intellect and introspection. With each session, the journey of transformation continues, gently shaping us into more aware, balanced, and responsible individuals.

** "Six Days to the Soul" **
 
 **A Poetic Reflection of an Unforgettable Induction Journey-By Harleen Kaur Grewal**

Day One began, not with noise, but grace, 

A whisper of truth in a fast-running race.

They said: "Don’t just study—learn to feel,

This one life—make it honest, make it real.

A story unfolded, of a boy divine, 

Who paused at “one” on learning’s line.

He questioned not to rebel, but to see— And found God in humility. 

"ੴ" whispered through ancient air,

One source, one truth, always there. 

Ask, introspect, eyes closed tight— 

We seek outside, but God is light.

Then a bowl sang—not words, but tone, 

Its echo taught: you're not alone. 

A teacher’s hand can shape your tune, 

From noise to resonance, like a sacred rune.

We learned of bones and what they meant— 

Not just in number, but how time is spent. 

A seed was shown, and with it prayer,

That growth begins with roots laid bare.

The stars above told Dhruva’s tale, 

Of hurt, of hope, of setting sail. 

In forest deep, he found his place, 

Not in court, but in God’s grace.

A number, 108, graced the board, 

A mystery held in symbols stored.

One for the divine, the zeroes aligned— 

And eight, the world we often mind.

Balance, they said, is the subtle key, 

To live, to love, and truly be.

Close your eyes, and see beyond,

Feel the truth—deep and fond. 

The mind’s a river, running fast,

But peace is found when we let go, at last.

Then voices came, soft yet strong,

Asking, “What if we’ve been wrong?”

Do dreams lead us toward the light? 

Or further from what feels right? 

Eighteen years behind us lie— 

Do we chase stars or ask the sky?

Happiness isn’t name or gold, 

But being fulfilled in the stories we hold.

We learned of loops—of mind and thought,

Of anger's cost, of peace well sought.

A circus within us, wild and loud,

Yet stillness makes the soul feel proud.

To choose what’s right, not guided blind,

But by the compass we hold inside.

Imagination, behavior—branches wide,

But roots must rest where truth resides. 

From sensation to acceptance, we’re often led—

But the truest path lies just ahead.

No borrowed light, no echoed scream, 

Just self-found truth, a living dream.

And then—force, a word so deep,

To pump our will, to wake from sleep.

The mind, they said, outruns the sound,

But only discipline can hold it down. 

Apply the pressure, become your guide— 

No mountain tall, no tide too wide.

Life is rise and fall—

But right approach answers all.

Clubs were born with visions bright,

To spark the minds, to fan the light.

Marketing digital, creative skill,

A platform to dream, a chance to fulfill.

Not just code or marks or race,

But growth in heart, in time, in place.

We clapped with empty hands that day, 

Still felt the spark in every way.

Extra effort, the final stride— 

To never give up, to never hide.

They asked us: What is life’s true aim? 

Is it wealth, or title, or fleeting fame? 

Or is it the courage to break the chain,

To smile through loss, to rise through pain?

Is it knowing when to stand alone, 

Yet never forgetting you’ve always grown?

And as the days came to a close, 

We felt the stir, the breath, the prose.

This wasn’t just an introduction—it was more,

It cracked us open, reached our core.

We didn’t just meet a college gate—

We walked through doors carved by fate.

A home of thought, a ground so wide, 

Where learning walks with soul as guide.

Six days, six seeds now in our hand,

Watered with wisdom, ready to stand.

We leave not just with plans or goal— 

But with a light stitched to the soul. 

**THANKYOU**
