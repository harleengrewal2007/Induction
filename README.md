***A New Chapter Begins: Unfolding the Student Induction Program 2025 at GNDEC Ludhiana***

"Education is the passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to those who prepare for it today." – Malcolm X

On the serene morning of 31st July, 2025, the campus of Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College, Ludhiana, brimmed with anticipation and youthful exuberance as it welcomed the newest members of its academic family — the freshers of Computer Science and Information Technology. The day marked the commencement of the Student Induction Program 2025, an event meticulously curated to ignite passion, foster belonging, and instill in every newcomer a sense of purpose.

The proceedings began at 8:30 AM in the sanctified presence of the Gurdwara Sahib, where students gathered in reverence and reflection. The spiritual start infused the day with a profound sense of calm and clarity, setting the tone for the journey ahead.Students were encouraged to observe the unique structure of the Gurdwara Sahib, which resembles a ship (jahaz)—symbolic of the spiritual journey it offers. Inside, the Kirtani Jatha recited soothing shabads, with the profound message “ਵਾਹਿਗੁਰੂ ਨਾਮ ਜਹਾਜ਼ ਹੈ ਚੜੇ ਸੋ ਉਤਰੇ ਪਾਰ”, reminding everyone that the divine name of Waheguru is the vessel that carries souls safely across life’s ocean. A touching moment during the Gurdwara Sahib session was when a young girl soulfully recited prayers and kirtan, while a little boy played the nagada with quiet devotion. Their innocent presence filled the space with pure spiritual energy, leaving a lasting impression on everyone.A special message was shared, emphasizing the importance of respecting and caring for one’s parents, staying rooted in humility, and visiting the Gurdwara Sahib regularly to seek guidance and blessings throughout their academic journey at GNDEC. The one-hour spent there served as a gentle spiritual beginning for all students, instilling gratitude, discipline, and inner strength.




The inaugural session was opened by the ever-inspiring Mr. Harsimran Singh Jaggi, whose eloquent address traced the rich legacy and unwavering vision of GNDEC. He vividly outlined the institution's pursuit of academic brilliance, research innovation, and student empowerment, emphasizing the holistic development that the college champions. His words were not merely informative, but ignited a flame of aspiration within every young heart.

Following this, the spotlight turned to two exemplary voices from the 2021–2025 batch, who returned to their alma mater not as students, but as torchbearers of success.

-Mr. Sangam Arora, the proud Computer Science topper and now a valued member of Arguesoft, took the stage with poise. He recounted his transformative journey at GNDEC, speaking candidly about perseverance, mentorship, and personal growth.

-Mr. Arshpreet Singh, the IT branch topper currently thriving at Airtel, Gurugram, followed suit with a heartfelt narrative of ambition and resilience. Their stories were not just recollections but blueprints for those who aspire to carve their own paths.

"The beautiful thing about learning is that no one can take it away from you." – B.B. King

Next, the students were graced with the warm and welcoming presence of Mrs. Harpreet Kaur Garewal, Head of the Department of Applied Sciences. Her address was a harmonious blend of wisdom and encouragement, urging students to embrace every challenge with passion and discipline. Her words, both maternal and motivational, resonated deeply with the freshers.Adding her signature blend of wisdom and warmth, Mrs. Harpreet Kaur Garewal, Head of the Department of Applied Sciences, delivered a powerfully metaphorical message that resonated deeply with the young audience. With a cheerful tone and infectious energy, she playfully remarked that the “school flight has landed, and the college one has just taken off,” symbolizing the beginning of a transformative journey. She emphasized that while placements are important, they are merely a small milestone in the larger journey of life — a journey that is ultimately shaped by the students themselves. Drawing an inspiring visual, she described the X-axis as representing Passion, Patience, Persistence, and Perseverance, while the Y-axis symbolized Growth. “Success is a vertical journey, and every step you take horizontally builds your path upward,” she noted. Urging students to embrace this path with enthusiasm, she encouraged them to clap with energy and optimism, creating a moment of unity and joy that reflected her ever-jovial nature and deep commitment to student growth.


The academic roadmap was further illuminated by Dr. Akshay Giddar, Dean of Academics, who offered strategic guidance on curriculum planning, time management, and tapping into the academic wealth of the institution. His interaction was both insightful and empowering, demystifying the expectations of college life.He emphasized that while growth is indeed vertical, powered by continuous learning and deep expertise, the horizontal steps represent the breadth of interdisciplinary skills, adaptability, and collaboration. “To truly thrive in today’s dynamic world,” he remarked, “engineers must not only excel deeply in their core domain but also develop the ability to connect across disciplines and functions — that is the essence of a T-shaped engineer.” His perspective provided the students with a practical and forward-looking framework to approach their academic and professional journey with purpose and direction.

Adding a heartfelt and youthful perspective to the event, I  Harleen Kaur Grewal, a first-year student from the Computer Science branch, took the stage to share my thoughts. In a short yet powerful address, I spoke about stepping into Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College with hope, faith, and determination. Drawing inspiration from the teachings of Guru Nanak Dev Ji, I reminded my fellow students that this institution is not just a place to earn a degree, but a sacred space to discover purpose and inner potential. Quoting, "ਮਨ ਤੂੰ ਜੋਤਿ ਸਰੂਪੁ ਹੈ ਆਪਣਾ ਮੂਲੁ ਪਛਾਣੁ" I encouraged everyone to recognize the divine light within and strive to make a meaningful difference in the world.

The program was then elevated by the magnetic presence of Dr. Parminder Singh, Dean of Student Welfare, whose motivational words injected a surge of positivity into the auditorium. His emphasis on mental well-being, co-curricular engagement, and balanced growth was both reassuring and empowering.

The event reached a moment of profound inspiration with the keynote address by Dr. Sehajpal Singh, Principal of GNDEC. His visionary words highlighted the importance of integrity, innovation, and intent in academic life. Encouraging students to think beyond the conventional, he invoked them to be architects of change, not just seekers of degrees.He expressed his joy at seeing the auditorium filled exclusively with students from the Computer Science and Information Technology branches—a testament to the growing popularity and demand of these fields in today’s world. He emphasized that while these branches have played a significant role in societal transformation over the past two decades, every branch of engineering holds equal importance in shaping civilization, lifestyle, and the quality of life. Welcoming the students warmly, he highlighted their immense potential and capabilities, reminding them that their growth and success ultimately depend on their own efforts, choices, and dedication.

The college had the immense honor of hosting two distinguished Guests of Honour:

Shri Ravindra Garg, Chief Engineer, Municipal Corporation, Ludhiana, addressed the students with a heartfelt and impactful message. He encouraged them to enjoy their college life but reminded them to do so within limits and with responsibility. Emphasizing the sacrifices and investments made by their parents, he urged students not to take this phase of life lightly. He left them with a powerful thought: “If you choose to enjoy now without discipline, you may suffer later; but if you stay focused now, you will enjoy the fruits of your efforts in the future.” His words served as a timely reminder of the importance of balance, gratitude, and long-term vision in a student’s life.

Engineer Rakesh Kumar, a distinguished alumnus from the 1991 batch and currently serving as ADC, Ludhiana, delivered an inspiring address that beautifully bridged the past and present. Reflecting on his own journey from the classrooms of GNDEC to a position of administrative leadership, he credited the college for laying the strong foundation of his career. With deep emotion, he shared the poetic line:

“ਕਲੇਜੇ ਤੀਰ ਦੇਖਣ ਨੂੰ, ਤੇ ਸਿਰ ਤੇ ਤਾਜ ਦੇਖਣ ਨੂੰ,

ਬੜੀ ਬੇਤਾਬ ਹੈ ਦੁਨੀਆ, ਤੇਰੀ ਪਰਵਾਜ਼ ਦੇਖਣ ਨੂੰ”

—reminding students that the world eagerly watches their rise, their struggles, and their triumphs. His words resonated deeply, encouraging students to aim high and honor the legacy of the institution through their actions and achievements.

"Success is not the key to happiness. Happiness is the key to success. If you love what you are doing, you will be successful." – Albert Schweitzer

The event concluded on a high note with a captivating interaction with Shri Ashok Singla, Financial Advisor, whose experiential wisdom and encouraging words provided the students with valuable direction. His pragmatic approach to career, finance, and life planning left a lasting impression on the audience.He addressed a crucial aspect of every student’s academic journey—financial planning. He introduced the students to the Vidya Lakshmi Education Loan Scheme, a government-backed portal that acts as a single-window platform for students seeking education loans. Shri Singla explained how the portal connects students with multiple banks and allows them to apply for loans, track applications, and receive guidance through a streamlined and transparent process. His session was especially beneficial for students who may require financial assistance to pursue their academic goals. By highlighting this resource, he encouraged students not to let financial constraints hinder their aspirations and assured them that support is available through proper channels when approached with the right intent and planning.



The first day of the induction program was much more than a ceremonial welcome — it was a celebration of potential, a convergence of experiences, and a beacon of inspiration for the Class of 2025. The seamless blend of motivation, mentorship, and meaningful dialogue created an atmosphere charged with enthusiasm and institutional pride.

With this, the corridors of GNDEC echo not only with knowledge but with stories waiting to unfold.

I extend my heartfelt gratitude to the management, faculty, organizing team,all the dignitaries, speakers, and participants for making the opening of the Student Induction Program 2025 a truly memorable and impactful event.

The day dawned bright as Day 2 of the Student Induction Programme at Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College, Ludhiana, unfolded with a strong focus on academic readiness and holistic wellness. The schedule included English and Mathematics Proficiency Tests, designed to help students evaluate their foundational skills and identify key areas for growth as they embark on their engineering journey. The structured assessments served as the first step in aligning students with the academic expectations of the institution.

Another important segment of Day 2 was the introduction of the Satya Scholarship Programme, a valuable initiative aimed at supporting and empowering meritorious students with financial assistance and skill-building opportunities. Professionals from Noida, representing the organization behind the scholarship, addressed the students and provided a comprehensive overview of the program. They elaborated on the eligibility criteria, application process, and long-term benefits of the scholarship, highlighting how it is designed not only to alleviate financial burdens but also to promote academic excellence, leadership, and social responsibility among students.

Throughout the session, Mrs. Harpreet Kaur Garewal, Head of the Department of Applied Sciences, actively engaged with the students, encouraging them to ask questions and clarify doubts. Her interactive approach helped bridge the communication between the presenters and the students, ensuring that the information was well understood and accessible to all. Her presence added a personal and motivational touch to the session, inspiring students to take advantage of such opportunities that can significantly enhance their educational journey.

A significant highlight of Day 2 was the expert lecture delivered by Dr. Arshdeep Singh, a seasoned professional in Food Technology at Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), Ludhiana. His session, titled “Food: A Pivotal Role in Student’s Overall Wellness,” offered the students valuable insights into the critical link between nutrition, lifestyle, and academic performance.

Dr. Singh began by emphasizing the importance of incorporating nutritionally rich and traditional foods such as millets and ghee into one’s daily diet. He explained that while our ancestors consumed large quantities of such foods due to their physically intensive lifestyles, today’s generation must consume them mindfully in line with modern activity levels. He introduced the concept of nutraceuticals—foods that provide medicinal or health benefits—including dark chocolate, advising students to choose such healthier alternatives for sustained growth and wellness.

He cautioned against the excessive consumption of refined sugars and carbonated beverages, pointing out that popular soft drinks like cola contain phosphoric acid and chemical sugars that can be harmful, while other sugary drinks often contain sucrose, offering little to no nutritional value. He highlighted that many so-called fruit drinks are merely flavored sugar beverages and not real fruit-based products.

Furthermore, he addressed popular fitness misconceptions, clarifying doubts related to the use of protein supplements among gym-going students. He explained the science behind macronutrients and stressed the importance of sourcing proteins and nutrients from natural, balanced diets over commercial products whenever possible.

One particularly impactful moment came when he addressed a common myth surrounding vitiligo, clarifying that it is a hereditary condition, not one caused by any particular food combination. His empathetic approach helped dispel fears and remove stigma related to the condition.

He concluded the session by encouraging students to make informed dietary choices, manage their stress levels to avoid emotional overeating, and approach wellness with a balanced and educated mindset. His talk was not only informative but also highly engaging, leaving students with a deeper appreciation of how food choices directly impact their academic success, physical health, and emotional well-being.

Following the insightful session on nutrition and wellness by Dr. Arshdeep Singh, the focus shifted to technical skill-building, essential for students in the fields of Computer Science and Information Technology. College faculty and technical professionals conducted a practical tutorial on GitHub, one of the most widely used platforms for version control and collaborative software development. Students were guided through the account creation process, introduced to key features of the platform, and shown how to begin building a professional coding portfolio.
