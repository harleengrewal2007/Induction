***A New Chapter Begins: Unfolding the Student Induction Program 2025 at GNDEC Ludhiana***

"Education is the passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to those who prepare for it today." – Malcolm X

On the serene morning of 31st July, 2025, the campus of Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College, Ludhiana, brimmed with anticipation and youthful exuberance as it welcomed the newest members of its academic family — the freshers of Computer Science and Information Technology. The day marked the commencement of the Student Induction Program 2025, an event meticulously curated to ignite passion, foster belonging, and instill in every newcomer a sense of purpose.

The proceedings began at 8:30 AM in the sanctified presence of the Gurdwara Sahib, where students gathered in reverence and reflection. The spiritual start infused the day with a profound sense of calm and clarity, setting the tone for the journey ahead.Students were encouraged to observe the unique structure of the Gurdwara Sahib, which resembles a ship (jahaz)—symbolic of the spiritual journey it offers. Inside, the Kirtani Jatha recited soothing shabads, with the profound message “ਵਾਹਿਗੁਰੂ ਨਾਮ ਜਹਾਜ਼ ਹੈ ਚੜੇ ਸੋ ਉਤਰੇ ਪਾਰ”, reminding everyone that the divine name of Waheguru is the vessel that carries souls safely across life’s ocean. A touching moment during the Gurdwara Sahib session was when a young girl soulfully recited prayers and kirtan, while a little boy played the nagada with quiet devotion. Their innocent presence filled the space with pure spiritual energy, leaving a lasting impression on everyone.A special message was shared, emphasizing the importance of respecting and caring for one’s parents, staying rooted in humility, and visiting the Gurdwara Sahib regularly to seek guidance and blessings throughout their academic journey at GNDEC. The one-hour spent there served as a gentle spiritual beginning for all students, instilling gratitude, discipline, and inner strength.




The inaugural session was opened by the ever-inspiring Mr. Harsimran Singh Jaggi, whose eloquent address traced the rich legacy and unwavering vision of GNDEC. He vividly outlined the institution's pursuit of academic brilliance, research innovation, and student empowerment, emphasizing the holistic development that the college champions. His words were not merely informative, but ignited a flame of aspiration within every young heart.

Following this, the spotlight turned to two exemplary voices from the 2021–2025 batch, who returned to their alma mater not as students, but as torchbearers of success.

-Mr. Sangam Arora, the proud Computer Science topper and now a valued member of Arguesoft, took the stage with poise. He recounted his transformative journey at GNDEC, speaking candidly about perseverance, mentorship, and personal growth.

-Mr. Arshpreet Singh, the IT branch topper currently thriving at Airtel, Gurugram, followed suit with a heartfelt narrative of ambition and resilience. Their stories were not just recollections but blueprints for those who aspire to carve their own paths.

"The beautiful thing about learning is that no one can take it away from you." – B.B. King

Next, the students were graced with the warm and welcoming presence of Mrs. Harpreet Kaur Garewal, Head of the Department of Applied Sciences. Her address was a harmonious blend of wisdom and encouragement, urging students to embrace every challenge with passion and discipline. Her words, both maternal and motivational, resonated deeply with the freshers.Adding her signature blend of wisdom and warmth, Mrs. Harpreet Kaur Garewal, Head of the Department of Applied Sciences, delivered a powerfully metaphorical message that resonated deeply with the young audience. With a cheerful tone and infectious energy, she playfully remarked that the “school flight has landed, and the college one has just taken off,” symbolizing the beginning of a transformative journey. She emphasized that while placements are important, they are merely a small milestone in the larger journey of life — a journey that is ultimately shaped by the students themselves. Drawing an inspiring visual, she described the X-axis as representing Passion, Patience, Persistence, and Perseverance, while the Y-axis symbolized Growth. “Success is a vertical journey, and every step you take horizontally builds your path upward,” she noted. Urging students to embrace this path with enthusiasm, she encouraged them to clap with energy and optimism, creating a moment of unity and joy that reflected her ever-jovial nature and deep commitment to student growth.


The academic roadmap was further illuminated by Dr. Akshay Giddar, Dean of Academics, who offered strategic guidance on curriculum planning, time management, and tapping into the academic wealth of the institution. His interaction was both insightful and empowering, demystifying the expectations of college life.He emphasized that while growth is indeed vertical, powered by continuous learning and deep expertise, the horizontal steps represent the breadth of interdisciplinary skills, adaptability, and collaboration. “To truly thrive in today’s dynamic world,” he remarked, “engineers must not only excel deeply in their core domain but also develop the ability to connect across disciplines and functions — that is the essence of a T-shaped engineer.” His perspective provided the students with a practical and forward-looking framework to approach their academic and professional journey with purpose and direction.

Adding a heartfelt and youthful perspective to the event, I  Harleen Kaur Grewal, a first-year student from the Computer Science branch, took the stage to share my thoughts. In a short yet powerful address, I spoke about stepping into Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College with hope, faith, and determination. Drawing inspiration from the teachings of Guru Nanak Dev Ji, I reminded my fellow students that this institution is not just a place to earn a degree, but a sacred space to discover purpose and inner potential. Quoting, "ਮਨ ਤੂੰ ਜੋਤਿ ਸਰੂਪੁ ਹੈ ਆਪਣਾ ਮੂਲੁ ਪਛਾਣੁ" I encouraged everyone to recognize the divine light within and strive to make a meaningful difference in the world.

The program was then elevated by the magnetic presence of Dr. Parminder Singh, Dean of Student Welfare, whose motivational words injected a surge of positivity into the auditorium. His emphasis on mental well-being, co-curricular engagement, and balanced growth was both reassuring and empowering.

The event reached a moment of profound inspiration with the keynote address by Dr. Sehajpal Singh, Principal of GNDEC. His visionary words highlighted the importance of integrity, innovation, and intent in academic life. Encouraging students to think beyond the conventional, he invoked them to be architects of change, not just seekers of degrees.

The college had the immense honor of hosting two distinguished Guests of Honour:

Shri Ravindra Garg, Chief Engineer, Municipal Corporation, Ludhiana, addressed the students with a heartfelt and impactful message. He encouraged them to enjoy their college life but reminded them to do so within limits and with responsibility. Emphasizing the sacrifices and investments made by their parents, he urged students not to take this phase of life lightly. He left them with a powerful thought: “If you choose to enjoy now without discipline, you may suffer later; but if you stay focused now, you will enjoy the fruits of your efforts in the future.” His words served as a timely reminder of the importance of balance, gratitude, and long-term vision in a student’s life.

Engineer Rakesh Kumar, a distinguished alumnus from the 1991 batch and currently serving as ADC, Ludhiana, delivered an inspiring address that beautifully bridged the past and present. Reflecting on his own journey from the classrooms of GNDEC to a position of administrative leadership, he credited the college for laying the strong foundation of his career. With deep emotion, he shared the poetic line:
“ਕਲੇਜੇ ਤੀਰ ਦੇਖਣ ਨੂੰ, ਤੇ ਸਿਰ ਤੇ ਤਾਜ ਦੇਖਣ ਨੂੰ,
ਬੜੀ ਬੇਤਾਬ ਹੈ ਦੁਨੀਆ, ਤੇਰੀ ਪਰਵਾਜ਼ ਦੇਖਣ ਨੂੰ”
—reminding students that the world eagerly watches their rise, their struggles, and their triumphs. His words resonated deeply, encouraging students to aim high and honor the legacy of the institution through their actions and achievements.

"Success is not the key to happiness. Happiness is the key to success. If you love what you are doing, you will be successful." – Albert Schweitzer

The event concluded on a high note with a captivating interaction with Shri Ashok Singla, Financial Advisor, whose experiential wisdom and encouraging words provided the students with valuable direction. His pragmatic approach to career, finance, and life planning left a lasting impression on the audience.He addressed a crucial aspect of every student’s academic journey—financial planning. He introduced the students to the Vidya Lakshmi Education Loan Scheme, a government-backed portal that acts as a single-window platform for students seeking education loans. Shri Singla explained how the portal connects students with multiple banks and allows them to apply for loans, track applications, and receive guidance through a streamlined and transparent process. His session was especially beneficial for students who may require financial assistance to pursue their academic goals. By highlighting this resource, he encouraged students not to let financial constraints hinder their aspirations and assured them that support is available through proper channels when approached with the right intent and planning.



The first day of the induction program was much more than a ceremonial welcome — it was a celebration of potential, a convergence of experiences, and a beacon of inspiration for the Class of 2025. The seamless blend of motivation, mentorship, and meaningful dialogue created an atmosphere charged with enthusiasm and institutional pride.

With this, the corridors of GNDEC echo not only with knowledge but with stories waiting to unfold.

I extend my heartfelt gratitude to the management, faculty, organizing team,all the dignitaries, speakers, and participants for making the opening of the Student Induction Program 2025 a truly memorable and impactful event.
